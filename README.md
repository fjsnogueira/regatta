# regatta
Software project to manage the regattas of my current rowing club.

After checking out the project, `cd` into the folder and run `composer.phar install` (see [Composer website](https://getcomposer.org/) for more information).

To start a local PHP server, do a `php bin/console server:start` from the root directory of this project.
